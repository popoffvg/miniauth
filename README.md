# miniauth

A small identity server in Go and PostgreSQL: password login, persistent browser sessions, personal access tokens, and a forward-auth endpoint for a reverse proxy such as Traefik.

Status: early. The service only answers `GET /healthz` today.

## Development

```sh
mise install   # Go 1.26 and task
task setup     # build the pinned tools, install the pre-push hook
task check     # lint, vet, gosec, tests with coverage
```

CI runs golangci-lint, go vet, gosec (results in the Security tab), and the tests with a gocov report. CodeRabbit reviews each pull request with the rules in `.coderabbit.yaml`.
